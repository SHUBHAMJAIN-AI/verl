# Training and Validation Batch Logging Features Added

## Summary of Changes:

### ✅ **1. Training Batch Logging Function** 
**Location**: `/root/verl/verl/trainer/ppo/ray_trainer.py`

**Added `_log_training_batch_examples()` method:**
- Logs first 3 examples from each training batch
- Shows UID, prompt (first 100 chars), response (first 100 chars), reward
- Controlled by `trainer.log_train_examples: 3` config
- Formatted output with clear separators for readability

### ✅ **2. Enhanced Validation Logging**
**Extended `_maybe_log_val_generations()` method:**
- Added console logging for first 3 validation examples
- Shows prompt, response, and score for debugging
- Maintains existing WandB table logging functionality
- Provides immediate visibility into validation performance

### ✅ **3. Training Output Saving**
**Added `_save_training_outputs()` method:**
- Saves complete training batch data to CSV files
- Includes step, UID, prompt, response, reward, lengths
- Creates files like `step_0001_training_batch.csv`
- Controlled by `trainer.save_training_outputs: true` config
- Configurable output directory with `trainer.training_output_dir`

### ✅ **4. Main Training Loop Integration**
**Modified training loop** (around line 1212):
- Added logging calls after reward computation
- Handles exceptions gracefully without breaking training
- Passes reward tensor and generation data to logging functions
- Logs at each training step for complete visibility

### ✅ **5. Configuration Updates**
**Updated config** `/root/verl/examples/split_placement/config/qwen_0.5b_2gpu_split.yaml`:
- `log_train_examples: 3` - Enable training batch logging
- `save_training_outputs: true` - Enable CSV output saving
- `training_output_dir: "training_outputs"` - Output directory
- `return_full_prompt: true` - Ensure prompts available for logging

## Expected Output:

### Console Logs:
```
============================================================
TRAINING STEP 1 BATCH EXAMPLES
============================================================

Example 1: UID=abc123
  Prompt: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many...
  Response: Let me solve this step by step. Natalia sold 48 clips in April...  
  Reward: 0.850

Example 2: UID=def456
  Prompt: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50...
  Response: I need to calculate how much Weng earned. She worked for 50 minutes...
  Reward: 0.120

Example 3: UID=ghi789
  Prompt: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100...
  Response: Betty needs $100 for the wallet. She has half of that which is $50...
  Reward: 1.000
============================================================

============================================================
VALIDATION BATCH EXAMPLES  
============================================================

Validation Example 1:
  Prompt: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast...
  Response: Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 duck eggs a day. She makes 9 * 2 = $18...
  Score: 1.000
============================================================
```

### CSV Output Files:
- `training_outputs/step_0001_training_batch.csv`
- `training_outputs/step_0002_training_batch.csv`
- etc.

**CSV Columns:**
- `step`, `example_idx`, `uid`, `prompt`, `response`, `reward`, `prompt_length`, `response_length`

## Debugging Benefits:

1. **Immediate Visibility**: See exactly what prompts and responses are being processed
2. **Reward Tracking**: Monitor reward computation for specific examples  
3. **Data Validation**: Verify that dataset parsing fixes are working correctly
4. **Training Analysis**: Complete CSV data for post-training analysis
5. **Issue Identification**: Quickly spot patterns in failing cases

## Usage:

The features are now enabled in the split PPO config. When you run:
```bash
./run_qwen_0.5b_2gpu_fixed_v2.sh
```

You'll see detailed batch examples in the console logs and CSV files will be saved to the `training_outputs/` directory for comprehensive analysis.
